## Installing IRBeast

As a Python 3 program, GatorGrader relies on
[Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for the installation of the libraries
on which it depends and the creation of the virtual environments in which it
runs. You may skip the *Dependencies* subsection if you have Python 3 and Pipenv
installed. You should also ensure that you have installed Git on your computer
and that you can run Git commands in a terminal window. Then, you can type the
following command in your terminal window to clone GatorGrader's GitHub
repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/GatorEducator/IRBeast.git
```

### Dependencies

Python comes pre-installed on many different distributions, and is available as
a package on most systems. However, there are certain features you might want
to use that are not available on your distroâ€™s package. Simply google `python
download` for your OS or follow the download and installation instructions on
[the Python website](https://www.python.org/).

[Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) is used by GatorGrader to create a
virtual environment, install and manage packages, and run Python commands. To
learn how to install and use Pipenv, please refer to the [Pipenv
Documentation](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/)
